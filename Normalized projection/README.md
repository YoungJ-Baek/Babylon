# Normalized projection
In this folder, I introduce normalized projection for classification.

In the code, there are two functions.

### Normalized_Projection : compute normalized projection.
### Nearest_Neighbor_Classification : classify images by normalized projection results and template matching

## Result

To print this result table, there is a use of printing function in the code. However, there is no printing function code in the file. It is very simple, so you can make it easily.
